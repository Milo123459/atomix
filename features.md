# Features

## deploy

A command for deploying your project to a cloud provider.

`deploy [optional-path]`

This then asks some questions (name, provider, etc), and opens a link to the deployment in the browser.

## new

A command for creating a new project, allowing you to get started very fast.

`new <name>`

This then asks some questions (git provider, license and project type) and then CD's into that directory.
